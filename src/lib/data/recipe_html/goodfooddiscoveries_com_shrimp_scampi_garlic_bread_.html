    "description": "Shrimp Scampi Garlic Bread is a delicious appetizer that originated from the famous shrimp scampi pasta dish, but with a twist! Instead of serving the shrimp scampi over pasta, we load all those savory shrimp onto a garlic-infused buttered baguette or ciabatta loaf. The result is an incredible medley of flavors that&#039;s easy to make and even easier to enjoy!",
