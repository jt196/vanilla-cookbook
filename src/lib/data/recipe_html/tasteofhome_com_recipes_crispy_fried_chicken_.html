            "reviewBody": "I've noticed a lot of negative reviews concerning this recipe. First, don't give up on it. Tweak it the way you like it...more garlic, well, throw more in. As for fried chicken being under cooked~ please remember to NOT over load the chicken in the HOT oil. Overloading tends to cool the fat down too much and never use cold chicken fresh from the fridge. Let it cool down a bit, also, steaming can help. Also, MAINTAIN a steady temperature  which is imperative. Use a thermometer and don't touch bone. I use my electric wok. KFC ALWAYS steamed their chicken AND they also added tomato powder to their seasoned dusting flour~ or so I was told. To me, buttermilk is great for fried chicken. Spend the extra money for pasture raised chicken....much more tasty. I NEVER use garlic salt or onion salt. I do add garlic and onion powders and salt separately among other seasonings. If you want more concentrated  seasoning flavor and you're not sure how much is just right add it to your flour and dip a finger in the flour after it has been mixed together for a taste ~ it won't hurt you. This is an excellent recipe. Please don't give up on it because yours didn't come out like KFC's {look for a KFC copy cat recipe instead of this one if this one doesn't meat your expectations} or lacked flavor. There are many factors as to why this may be the case.....your chicken being one of them or cheap oil another. Personally, I prefer lard. Oh, if the chicken still is somewhat under cooked just throw it in the {hot} 350 degree oven for 10 or 20 minutes. It will remain nice and crispy. Good recipe in my opinion.",

A couple words of advice to other cooks: if your chicken is under cooked, simply put it back in the fryer for a couple minutes. Make sure your instant read thermometer is not touching a bone or your reading will not be accurate. As for seasoning, any cook must be able to adjust seasonings to their own tastes. If you like it spicy, add some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes. Do not drain the chicken on paper towels. Drain the chicken pieces on a rack with paper towel underneath, otherwise your crust will turn to mush sitting on the paper towel. And as another user remarked, your oil or shortening must come back up to temperature before you add another batch of raw chicken. That is on the cook, not the recipe.",

Either way you're going to enjoy it.....Works great when making home made tenders or nuggets too!",
