    "description": "You can use another stone fruit. Peaches should be peeled but don’t peel nectarines, plums, or apricots. In the winter, it can be made with poached pears. In place of the raspberries, blueberries, cherries, another bushberry can be used. It’s classic to use blanched almond flour for frangipane, but feel free to use unblanched almond flour. Hazelnut, walnut, or even pistachio flour are fine to use as well, if those are available.",
