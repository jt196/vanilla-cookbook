    "name": "Easy Ground Pork Meat Filling For Ravioli",
    "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\nMade with fast cooking ground pork, bacon, onions, celery, garlic and rosemary this was my recipe testers' favorite meat filling! The filling can be made in advance, up to 3 days in the fridge. Use it to make your very own Italian meat ravioli with my master fresh homemade pasta recipe or sourdough pasta. Recipe adapted with changes from Jamie Oliver.\r\nHelpful Tools:\r\n\r\nFood processor (for blending the meat filling into a paste)\r\nTablespoon-sized cookie scoop (for quick &amp; easy portioning)\r\nFluted ravioli cutter or ravioli mold (read note below)\r\n\r\nA Note On Ravioli Yield:\r\nHow many ravioli does this recipe make? If you follow my exact technique outlined below you will get (20) 2 1/2- 3 inch ravioli. So for example, to feed 4 people, each person would get 5 ravioli with sauce. This portion size might not sound like a lot, but meat ravioli is filling! \r\nNow, if you use a different ravioli technique (there are a few), your yield might increase. For example, a ravioli mold with 12 spaces will get you approximately 48 ravioli. In comparison to my hand-cut technique, ravioli molds are very \"filling heavy\" and feature little to no pasta on the sides (for me, the pasta is the best part). Cutting ravioli by hand allows you to control the overall size and the filling to pasta ratio. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally: if you want to hand-cut your ravioli using my technique below, but want to increase the yield to more than (20) pieces, you do not need to double the recipe. Make them smaller. To do so: Assemble 2 rows of filling/ pasta sheet (instead of 1), decreasing the filling size from 1 tablespoon to 1/2 tablespoon to fit side-by-side. Or, roll the dough even thinner than the suggested thickness of approximately .40mm (#5 on Kitchen Aid) to .30mm (#6 on Kitchen Aid) to increase the length of your pasta sheets. The longer the sheets, the more ravioli you can make.",

This will help the sauce thicken properly. Add the sage leaves. Simmer until the sauce reduces and lightly coats the back of a metal spoon, about 10+ minutes. Taste and season with salt. Remove pan from heat. Gently reheat the sauce when ready to serve. (Optional step): in a separate small skillet, melt 30 g (2 tbsp) of unsalted butter over medium-low heat. Once the foam subsides, cook the butter stirring with a rubber spatula, until it turns light golden brown. This is &#8220;brown butter.&#8221; It happens fast! Transfer to a small bowl.
