And if you don't have an oven, you can use a tawa or pan to make them as well. To cook the banjara kebab in oven first preheat the oven for fifteen minutes. If you are using wooden sticks then soaked them in water for thirty minutes and line a baking tray with aluminium foil. Bring the marinated chicken and thread one by one in sticks or shewers. Keep a minimum gaps between the chicken while threading in the sticks. This will help to cook the chicken evenly from all sides. Now place them over the tray and brush with some butter. Place the baking tray inside the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the kebab become crisp golden.",
