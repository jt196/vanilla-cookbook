Here’s the real smoked ribs recipe, good enough to bring home a trophy in a cook-off. In fact, many readers have done exactly that with this ribs recipe.\n\nWhile many sites out there tell you to use something known as the 3-2-1 method, cooking the ribs in foil for 2 hours is far too long and can make the meat mushy and overcooked, a.k.a. “fall-of-the-bone ribs,” which, despite what others might tell you is actually a sign that they are overcooked. Instead, you should be able to take a bite that is pulled easily away from the bone without taking all of the meat with you. \n\nIt’s time to master the basic concepts, after which you’ll be cooking killer authentic smoked BBQ ribs on most charcoal and gas grills, whether spare ribs, baby back ribs, or St. Louis spare ribs!\nCreate championship Southern style, low & slow, tender and juicy barbecue ribs on a simple grill.

The key to saucing ribs is to go easy on it so that the meat can shine through. Simply paint both sides of the rack with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or store-bought barbecue sauce and cook for another 15 minutes or so.  Don&#039;t put the sauce on earlier than that. It has sugar and there is a risk it can burn. Now here&#039;s a trick I like: Sizzle on the sauce. Put the ribs with sauce directly over the hottest part of a grill in order to caramelize and crisp the sauce. On a charcoal grill, just move the slab over the coals. On a gas grill, crank up all the burners. On a water smoker, remove the water pan and move the meat close to the coals. On an offset smoker, put a grate over the coals in the firebox and put the meat there. With the lid open so you don&#039;t roast the meat from above, sizzle the sauce on one side and then the other. The sauce will actually sizzle and bubble. Stand by your grill and watch because sweet sauce can go from caramelized to carbonized in less than a minute! One coat of a thick sauce should be enough, but if you need two, go ahead, but don&#039;t hide all the fabulous flavors under too much sauce. If you think you&#039;ll want more sauce, put some in a bowl on the table.",
