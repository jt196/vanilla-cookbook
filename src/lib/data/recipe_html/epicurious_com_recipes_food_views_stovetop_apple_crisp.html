It’s a one-skillet fuss-free way to make a classic apple crisp without ever having to turn on your oven. A quick stovetop streusel is made by mixing flour, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon, salt, melted butter, and vanilla extract until large, irregular clumps form. Those clusters get cooked in a skillet until golden brown and crisp. The streusel is transferred to a large plate or baking sheet to cool, while tart Granny Smith apples get their turn to cook in the same skillet, along with brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and a splash of lemon juice to liven things up. The streusel is scattered on top of the tender apples and the crisp is ready to be served. Hot from the stovetop, the crisp is delicious served with scoops of melting vanilla ice cream; once cooled, the filling thickens up and the crisp is delightful served over Greek yogurt or simply all by itself.",
