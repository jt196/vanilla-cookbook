A Bolognese.\n\nA traditional Bolognese takes hours to make in a saucepan. The meat must simmer in wine for flavor infusion with water often needing to be added so the meat doesn't dry out as the sauce reduces. It's a delicate balance and a babysitting job for sure.\n\nForget all of that here. Even better? This will all be done (pasta AND sauce) IN. ONE. POT. (Such as your Instant Pot or Ninja Foodi) and in a FRACTION of the time the old-school method without compromising any of the incredible flavor whatsoever.\n\nFolks, I have created what I feel is the definitive Bolognese sauce. And I am sure you're going to love it.\n\n#pressureluck #instantpot #bolognese\n\nVISIT https://pressureluckcooking.com for MORE written recipes and easy-to-follow videos - with more always being added!\n\nWant the products I recommend and use?
