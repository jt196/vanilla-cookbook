        "Season salmon with coconut sugar, sea salt &amp; pepper.",
        "Set a nonstick skillet on medium high heat.Â  Once hot, spray with oil then add the salmon cubes.Â  Sear for 1 &#8211; 3 minutes, or until sear marks appear.Â  (Note: monitor the heat because the coconut sugar will burn so sear marks should appear faster than normal.)\nUse tongs to flip the salmon over to cook for another 1 &#8211; 3 minutes until you reach your desired level of doneness.Â  Remove and set aside.",
        "Reduce the heat to low, then add butter, sriracha and garlic.Â  Stir immediately and ensure the skillet is not so hot that it simmers the butter or sauce.Â  Add the salmon back to the skillet and gently fold into the sauce.",
        "Enjoy with your choice of grain or cauliflower rice and avocado-mango salsa.",
        "Mix the ingredients together in a bowl.Â  Enjoy with the fire salmon!"
