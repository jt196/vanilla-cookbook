If it gets below 6 cups, add more cold water. Boil longer until the broth is nice and milky and you still have at least 6 cups of broth.\n\nRemove from the heat. Strain the bones to separate from the broth.\n\nLet the bones cool down until you can handle them, and remove any ligaments or bits of meat left on them. Keep the bits in a bowl.\n\nLet the broth cool down. Keep it in the fridge for several hours or overnight until it solidifies. If you can’t wait that long, you can fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, and set your bowl of broth on top of it. Change the water and ice one time. Your broth will end up cool and wobbly.\n\nYou’ll see a layer of brownish yellow fat has solidified on the surface, skim it off with a spoon.\n\nUsing a pressure cooker: easier and faster\n\nIf you have a pressure cooker, you can use it instead of boiling bones in a pot for hours. Simply cook the bones in your pressure cooker with 10 cups of water for about 30 minutes.\n\nLet it cool down. Skim any solidified fat off the top, and then put it in a pot with some more water and boil over medium heat until the broth is milky. Add more water as needed, until you have 6 cups of milky broth.\n\nMake haejangguk\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the cabbage for 5 minutes. Strain and rinse in cold water a couple of times to remove any dirt left. Strain the cabbage and chop up into small pieces.\n\nCombine the cabbage, doenjang, garlic, green chili pepper, and fish sauce in a bowl and mix it well by hand or a wooden spoon.\n\nPut the cabbage mix to a large pot with 6 cups of bone broth along with the leftover bits of ligament and meat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes over medium high heat.\n\nTurn down the heat to low and cook for another 10 minutes.\n\nServe\n\nLadle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle chopped onion over top.\n\nServe with rice, kimchi, gochu-garu, and a few more side dishes if you want. Spicy cucumber salad (oi-muchim: 오이무침)",

(The chickpeas will double in volume, so use more water than you think you need.) Soak the chickpeas overnight at room temperature. The next day, drain the chickpeas and rinse under cold water.\n\nPlace the chickpeas in a large pot with the remaining 1 teaspoon baking soda and add cold water to cover by at least 4 inches. Bring the chickpeas to a boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface. Lower the heat to medium, cover the pot, and continue to simmer for about 1 hour, until the chickpeas are completely tender. Then simmer them a little more. (The secret to creamy hummus is overcooked chickpeas; don't worry if they are mushy and falling apart a little.) Drain.\n\nMeanwhile, process garlic, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until coarsely puréed; let sit 10 minutes to allow garlic to mellow.\n\nStrain garlic mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to food processor; discard solids. Add tahini and pulse to combine. With motor running, add 1/4 cup ice water by the tablespoonful and process (it may seize up at first) until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick. Add chickpeas and cumin and puree for several minutes, until the hummus is smooth and uber-creamy. Then purée it some more! Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, lemon juice, and cumin if you like.\n\nTo serve, spread the hummus in a shallow bowl, dust with paprika, top with parsley and more tehina sauce if you have any left, and drizzle generously with oil.",

		"directions": "Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot. Add water that is three times as deep as the beans, cover, and cook over medium-high heat for 1 hour.\n\nTurn the heat down to medium and continue cooking until the beans are soft enough mash easily, 4½ to 5 hours, checking to make sure the beans remain covered with water, and replenishing as necessary. Drain the beans in a colander.\n\nMash the drained beans to a paste in batches with a large mortar and pestle or in a food processor. Don’t finely grind them, leave some beans half-crushed.\n\nDivide the mashed beans into 3 portions. Knead each portion with both hands and shape into a firm rectangular block measuring 6 x 3 x 4 inches.\n\nTie each block up in cotton twine and hang them. You can hang them outside but be sure to keep them covered and out of the rain, and if it’s too hot out they may rot. Inside, you can hang them from the ceiling with hooks. Wherever they hang, the spot should be cool and well-ventilated and all sides of the blocks should be exposed to air and not touching each other. Let the blocks hang for 6 weeks, until they are well dried out and smell a little pungent when you get your nose close to them.\n\nNow it’s time to ferment the bean blocks. Place a layer of dried rice straw or hay in the bottom of a cardboard box that’s just big enough to hold the blocks with a little space between them; the straw will insulate the blocks and attract good bacteria like Bacillus subtilis in the air. (Don’t worry if you can’t find straw or hay; the blocks will still attract good bacteria.)\n\nCover the box and put it on the electric blanket. Set the heat to low and let the bean blocks ferment for 2 weeks. At this point, the well-fermented bean blocks will smell a little earthy and pungent and will be covered with white, brownish-yellow, or sometimes greenish fungi. (These fungi change the bean proteins to peptides and amino acids, which will give the bean paste its delicious nutty flavor.)\n\nTie the fermented bean blocks up in cotton twine and hang from the ceiling, as before, for 1 month.\n\nSoak the meju in brine\n\nWash the blocks in cold water and to remove the fungi. Place the blocks in a shallow basket or on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper and let them dry in the sunlight for 1 day, turning them until every side of each block is dried.\n\nCombine the 3½ gallons water (56 cups) and 5 quarts of the kosher salt (20 cups) in a large bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until the salt is thoroughly dissolved.\n\nSet out a 4- to 5-gallon earthenware crock. Put 2 pieces of the charcoal on a gas burner; turn on the flame, and heat until they are glowing red. (If you don’t have a gas burner, use the broiler: Put the charcoal pieces under the broiler and turn it on; remove the charcoal when it is red.) Use tongs to transfer the charcoal to the earthenware crock. Drizzle the honey over the burning charcoal. Cover the crock and wait for 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the lid. You will see lots of smoke and smell a good caramel aroma. This process sterilizes the inside of the crock and will give the sauce good flavor.\n\nRemove the charcoal and wipe the inside of the crock with paper towels. Add the bean blocks and salted water to the crock. Add the remaining piece of charcoal, the jujubes, and dried hot peppers; they will float on the surface of the water. (The charcoal will attract and absorb any dust. The jujubes add sweetness and the dried red peppers help prevent the blocks from going bad.)\n\nCover the crock with flour sacking or cheesecloth and put on the lid. Let the blocks soak in the salty water until well fermented, 2 to 3 months. On clear days remove the lid and let the crock sit in the sunlight. Close it at night and be sure to keep the crock covered with the cloth so bugs and dust can’t get in. As time passes, the salty water will turn brown and smell like deeply fermented soy sauce.\n\nSeparate the doenjang from the soy sauce\n\nDiscard the charcoal, jujubes, and peppers. Transfer the soaked bean blocks to a large bowl. The blocks may have broken up during the soak, so use a bowl to scoop the soy sauce out of the crock and into a strainer set over another large bowl. Add any pieces of bean block to the bean block bowl. Save the soy sauce for making Korean soup soy sauce (gukganjang) later.\n\nMix the doenjang with both hands, breaking it up into a paste, and transfer it to a 5-quart earthenware crock. Pack it down and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup kosher salt. Cover with the cotton cloth, secure it with a rubber band, and put on the lid.\n\nPut the doenjang crock in a sunny spot for its final fermentation. About twice a week on sunny days, remove the lid and let the sunlight shine into the crock through the cotton cloth. When it’s well fermented, the doenjang will smell sweet and taste salty and earthy, with a deep flavor. This will take 5 to 6 months. If it ever looks a little too dry on top, pour some of the separated soy sauce on top to make it moist again. You don’t need to stir it in.\n\nServing and storage\n\nStore the doenjang in the crock outside the house or at room temperature. Whenever you take some out, press the rest down with a spoon to keep out the air. Once in a while, take the lid off, cover with a cotton cloth, and let the sun hit it again.",

		"directions": "To make the overnight soy eggs, first, set up somewhere to leave your eggs to marinate. I like to use a Kilner jar, but you could also use a deep plastic box.\n\nPour the soy sauce, vinegar, caster sugar and 150ml of cold water into your chosen container and stir to mix.\n\nNext, take a bowl that will fit all the eggs and put a couple of handfuls of ice in it. Add cold water to the bowl so it’s three-quarters full, and leave to one side.\n\nTo cook the eggs, take a saucepan just big enough to hold the eggs snugly (so they can’t rattle around too much), fill it half full of water and bring to the boil over a medium-high heat. When the water is at a rolling boil, gently lower the eggs into the water using a large spoon.\n\nCook for exactly 7 minutes (set a timer) from the moment the last egg hits the water. Drain and pop the eggs into the bowl of iced water to cool off.\n\nLeave for 10 minutes, then peel the eggs (it sometimes helps to peel under the water to keep them perfect) and drop them into the soy mixture.\n\nPut a piece of kitchen paper over the eggs to keep them submerged, and place in the fridge. Leave overnight, then remove the eggs from the solution and transfer to an airtight container in the morning.\n\nThey will keep for a week in the fridge (and the solution can be used for another round of eggs).\n\nFor the ramen, in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, warm the oil over a medium heat. Add the onions, garlic and salt, stir and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the onions become translucent. Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and continue to cook for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. The onions will gradually caramelise and colour, eventually breaking down. Add the chilli and stock, bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer and add the sake, soy sauce and brown rice miso, stirring well to combine. Check the seasoning.\n\nCook your noodles according to the packet instructions. Refresh in cold water and stir in a little oil to keep them from sticking. Finally, bring the broth back to the boil, add the choi sum and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until tender.\n\nTo serve, divide your noodles between four bowls and ladle the broth and greens over the noodles. If you’re serving the eggs, halve and pop on top, along with some chilli oil if you like.",

		"description": "why this recipe works After years of turning out fries of every stripe, we know a good fry when we taste one: the browned, crisp exterior, the fluffy center. And we know that achieving this ideal requires a few tricks, typically a presoak and a two-part frying. But who can argue with the promise of fries cooked with minimal effort or oil? So, holding doubts in check, we set out to create the ideal air-fryer French fry. Some recipes called for hours of prework. Others had you throw the potatoes in the basket and cross your fingers. From dry, hollow sticks to limp, greasy planks, not one passed muster. Seventy pounds of potatoes later, we learned that air-fryer fries require the same tricks as their deep-fried cousins: soaking, a low-temp fry to par-cook the spuds, and a high-temp fry to crisp them. But we found shortcuts: A rinse and a 10-minute soak in hot water was sufficient. Cutting thick fries prevented hollow centers and yielded a great crispy-fluffy ratio. Still, our fries tasted lean. A second toss in a bit of oil and salt in between fryings proved the solution, producing crisp, perfectly seasoned results. Excellent homemade fries had never been easier. Frequently tossing the potatoes ensured the most even cooking and the best browning. We found tossing the fries in a bowl, rather than in the basket, yielded the best results and the fewest broken fries. Do not clean out the tossing bowl while you are cooking; the residual oil helps the crisping process. Serve with Sriracha Dipping Sauce.",

Stack 3 or 4 planks and cut into ½-inch-thick sticks; repeat with remaining planks.\n\n2 Submerge potatoes in large bowl of water and rinse to remove excess starch. Drain potatoes and repeat process as needed until water remains clear. Cover potatoes with hot tap water and let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes, transfer to paper towel–lined rimmed baking sheet, and thoroughly pat dry.\n\n3 Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil in clean, dry bowl, then transfer to air-fryer basket. Place basket in air fryer, set temperature to 350 degrees, and cook for 8 minutes. Transfer potatoes to now-empty bowl and gently toss to redistribute. Return potatoes to air fryer and cook until softened and potatoes have turned from white to blond (potatoes may be spotty brown at tips), 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n4 Transfer potatoes to now-empty bowl and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and ½ teaspoon salt. Return potatoes to air fryer, increase temperature to 400 degrees, and cook until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, tossing gently in bowl to redistribute every 5 minutes. Transfer fries to large plate and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n\nSRIRACHA DIPPING SAUCE\nWhisk ¼ cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon sriracha, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1½ teaspoons grated fresh ginger, and ⅛ teaspoon soy sauce together in bowl.",

		"directions": "1) Opt for rice that is naturally soft, springy, and fragrant. I found the best results with short-grain Japanese and Taiwanese rice; long-grain rice (like basmati, jasmine), glutinous rice, or rice flour all give poor results. Wash the rice like you would for cooking and soak in new water for 2 hrs, at room temp. \n2) Drain rice well and add to a high-powered blender along with all ingredients, yeast last. Blend until very, very fine, about 2-3 mins; unblended grains will sink to the bottom, causing problems in the rising / baking process. Now the batter should be warm, about 40 C (105 F), no hotter. \n3) Pour the batter into a lightly-greased non-stick loaf pan (consider parchment paper if yours isn’t non-stick). Mine is 24 cm x 10.5 cm x 9 cm. Whichever loaf pan you choose, make sure the batter only comes half-way up initially. \n4) Cover and proof at 40 C (I use my oven’s lowest temp) until 1½ times the original size. Take the pan out and preheat the oven to 190 C (375 F). As soon as the batter rises to nearly 2 times the original size, bake uncovered for 35-40 mins, or until golden-brown on top. Be sure to spritz the top with water every now and then, as the rice batter is highly prone to drying-out. \n5) Once baked, release the loaf onto a wire rack, to cool. It’s best fresh, but can last a few days in the fridge.",

		"directions": "Mix all of the ingredients in the order listed, and mix and knead — by hand, or using a stand mixer — to make a smooth dough. It won't be particularly soft nor stiff; it should be smooth and feel bouncy and elastic under your hands.\n\nPlace the dough in a lightly greased bowl, or large (8-cup) measuring cup. Cover it, and let it rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's become quite puffy, though not necessarily doubled in size.\n\nGently deflate the dough, and shape it into a fat 9\" log. Place it in a lightly greased 9\" x 5\" or 10\" x 5\" loaf pan.\n\nCover the pan, and let the dough rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's crowned 1\" to 1 1/2\" over the rim of the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\nBake the bread for 20 minutes. Tent it lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, till it's golden brown. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 195°F to 200°F.\n\nRemove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a rack to cool. When completely cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature.\n\nTips from our Bakers\n\nIf you're short on yeast and want to reduce the amount you use in this recipe, here's how: Cut the yeast from 2 1/4 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon. For its first rise, cover the bowl and place the dough in a warmer than usual environment, about 85°F to 88°F or so. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size, about 2 hours. Shape the dough, put it in the pan, and let it rise in its warm environment for another hour, or until it's noticeably puffy. Bake as directed. Alternatively, you can let the reduced-yeast dough rise at normal room temperature (65°F to 70°); it will take about 3 hours for its first rise, and another 3 hours once it's shaped and in the pan. For more information see our blog post, How to bake bread using less yeast.\n\nWant to make this bread using a bread machine? See our Walter Sands' Favorite Bread — Bread Machine Version.\n\nWe call for a fairly wide range of water here due to two variables: how bakers measure their flour, and climate/season. Flour is drier and will absorb more liquid in winter, and/or in a dry climate; in summer or in a humid climate, it's moister and will absorb less. So generally speaking, you'll use more liquid in your bread in winter, less in summer. In addition, some bakers measure their flour by dipping the cup into the bag or canister, tapping the flour to pack it down, and leveling it off. The way we measure flour here at King Arthur is to stir/aerate the flour, sprinkle it gently into the measuring cup, and level it off. If you're of the scoop/tap/level school, which measures a \"heavier\" cup of flour, you'll need to use more liquid. At any rate, for this recipe, start with a smaller amount of water and move up, if necessary; it's easier to add water than to take it out! Your goal is a dough that starts out a bit sticky, but as you knead becomes soft (but not sticky) and smooth, not \"gnarly.\"",

		"directions": "Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dough should be sticky; adjust with more flour or water to achieve what's shown in the video.\n\nTransfer dough onto a well floured surface. Dust a little more flour over the top. Knead for a minute or two to form a round. Cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nRoll dough into a square about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour as necessary; dough should still be sticky.\n\nSpread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the square using a silicone spatula, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Flip the unbuttered side over the middle of the square and fold the opposite end over it like a letter. Straighten the edges as needed.\n\nTurn dough with a bench scraper to unstick it from the counter; dust with flour. Flip and sprinkle more flour on top. Roll dough into a 1/8-inch-thick rectangle, carefully stretching edges as needed. Spread another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the dough. Fold into thirds. Transfer onto a lined baking sheet and freeze until butter is slightly chilled, about 10 minutes.\n\nSprinkle dough with flour and roll into a square a little over 1/8 inch thick. Spread remaining butter over the dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch border on the top edge. Dip your finger in water and lightly moisten the unbuttered edge. Roll dough into a log starting from the bottom edge. Dust with more flour and polish the ends as needed. Seal with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\n\nCombine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a pot. Boil over medium heat, without stirring, until syrup reaches 210 to 215 degrees F (100 degrees C). Remove from heat.\n\nPreheat oven 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.\n\nWhisk flour, salt, and cold milk together very thoroughly in a cold pot. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until milk thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes.\n\nWhisk egg yolks into the cooled milk. Add the sugar syrup and vanilla extract. Mix until combined. Strain custard into a glass measuring cup.\n\nUnwrap the dough and trim any uneven bits on the ends. Score log into 12 even pieces using a knife; cut through.\n\nPlace a piece of dough in each muffin cup. Dip your thumb lightly in some cold water. Press thumb into the center of the swirl; push dough against the bottom and up the sides of the cup until it reaches least 1/8 inch past the top. Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with custard.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until the pastry is browned and bubbly, and the tops start to blister and caramelize, about 12 minutes. Cool tarts briefly and serve warm.",

		"description": "This is Japanese comfort food, easily prepared at home but most often eaten for lunch in small neighborhood restaurants. Donburi are one-dish meals in which a topping of well-flavored meat, eggs, tofu, or a combination is served over rice. (The name donburi comes from the large bowl of the same name that the dish is served in.)\n\nKyoto is known for its oyako don, or “parent and child donburi” (because both chicken and egg are used in the savory topping). The whole dish can be prepared in forty minutes (including soaking time for the mushrooms)—the length of time it takes to prepare the rice properly. It makes a good lunch, with miso soup, or less traditionally, a salad such as Cucumber and Wakame Salad (page 191) or Intensely Green Spinach with Sesame Seeds (page 193).",

		"directions": "Wash the rice well in several changes of water until the water runs clear. Let stand in a sieve for 20 to 30 minutes, then place the rice in a heavy medium pot with the cold water. Bring to a boil, cover tightly, and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes, still covered. Alternatively, cook the rice in a rice cooker.\n\nMeanwhile, before putting the rice on to cook, begin preparing the other ingredients: Wipe off the mushrooms, place in a small bowl with the warm water, top with a small lid or bowl to press them down, and soak for 30 minutes. When the mushrooms are softened, remove from the water and slice into very thin strips, discarding the hard stems. Set aside both the mushrooms and the soaking water.\n\nCut the chicken lengthwise into 1-inch strips, then thinly slice across the grain. Place the marinade ingredients in a bowl, add the chicken, and turn to coat. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nIf using water and bonito flakes, bring the water to a boil, toss in the bonito flakes, and remove from the heat. When the flakes have settled, strain through a cloth and discard the flakes.\n\nTen minutes before you plan to serve the dish, place the dashi or bonito broth and the mushroom soaking water in a heavy nonreactive saucepan. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar and heat to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the chicken and mushroom slices and simmer until the chicken has turned white all over. Stir in the scallions. Whisk the eggs with the salt until frothy, pour into the pan, and simmer for 2 minutes, without stirring. Cover and after 20 seconds, turn the heat to very low and let steam until the eggs are cooked but still very soft, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nPlace the rice in four bowls, top each with a quarter of the egg and chicken mixture, and serve, with the optional topping(s) if you wish.\n\nNote: You can also begin with leftover cooked rice. You will need about 5 cups cooked rice.",

Dry-fry, moving them frequently until they are blackened on the outside and the garlic and onions feel soft inside. Leave to cool, then peel with a sharp knife.\n\nIn the same pan over a low heat, toast the spices until they begin to smell fragrant – about 2-3 minutes. Leave to cool, then lightly grind and place in a spice bag or tie up in muslin or a clean kitchen cloth.\n\nAdd the peeled vegetables and spice bag to the oxtails along with the salt, fish sauce and sugar. Continue simmering for 3 hours until the meat is falling off the bones.\n\nStrain and discard everything other than the meat, then return stock to the same pan. Adjust the seasoning to taste, adding fish sauce, sugar or salt until it tastes good to you. Pull the meat off the bones and discard the bones and any gristle.\n\nBring a pan of water to the boil, pour over the noodles and leave for 15 minutes until tender. Rinse under cold water so they don’t stick together, then place in your serving bowls. Ladle over the hot stock and the oxtail meat and serve with the garnishes, encouraging people to help themselves.",

Cool the cake in its pan on a rack for 10 minutes, and then release the spring and let it finish cooling just on the base. Once it's cool, serve as soon as possible. Or, you can double-wrap the torte in foil, put it in a sealed plastic bag and freeze (for up to one year!). Note: to serve a torte that has been frozen, defrost it completely and then reheat it for 5 to 10 minutes in a 300-degree oven.",

		"directions": "Combine the flour, salt, yeast and water in the bowl of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment and mix for 2 minutes on low speed. Switch to the dough hook and mix for 5 to 6 minutes on medium speed. The dough should be sticky on the bottom of the bowl, but it should release from the sides of the bowl. If not, sprinkle in a small amount of flour until this occurs (or dribble in water if the dough seems too stiff and clears the bottom as well as the sides of the bowl).\n\nLightly oil a large bowl and immediately transfer the dough with a spatula or bowl scraper dipped in water into the bowl. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Immediately place the bowl in the refrigerator and chill overnight, to retard fermentation.\n\nThe next day, check the dough to see if it has risen in the refrigerator. It will probably be partially risen but not doubled in size (the amount of rise will depend on how cold the refrigerator is and how often the door was opened). Leave the bowl of dough out at room temperature for about 2 to 3 hours (or longer if necessary) to allow the dough to wake up, lose its chill, and continue fermenting.\n\nWhen the dough has doubled from its original prerefrigerated size, liberally sprinkle the counter with bread flour (about 1/2 cup). Gently transfer the dough to the floured counter with a plastic dough scraper that has been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you. Avoid punching down the dough as you transfer it, to expel as little as possible of the carbon-dioxide gas that has built up in the dough during fermentation.\n\nIf the dough is very wet, sprinkle more flour over the top as well as under it. Dry your hands thoroughly and then dip them in flour. Roll the dough gently in the sprinkled flour to coat it thoroughly, simultaneously stretching it into an oblong about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide. If it is too sticky to handle, continue sprinkling flour over it.\n\nDip a metal pastry scraper into cool water to keep it from sticking to the dough, and cut the dough in half widthwise with the pastry scraper by pressing it down through the dough until it severs it, then dipping it again in the water and repeating this action until you have cut down the full length of the dough. (Do not use this blade as a saw; use it as a pincer, pinching the dough cleanly with each cut.) Let the dough relax for 5 minutes.\n\nPrepare the oven for hearth baking, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500 F, or 550 F if your oven goes this high. Cover the back of two 17-by-12-inch sheet pans with baking parchment and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal.\n\nFOR BAGUETTES:\n\nTake one of the dough pieces and repeat the cutting action, but this time cut off 3 equal-sized lengths. Then do the same with the remaining half. This should give you 6 lengths.\n\nFlour your hands and carefully lift one of the dough strips and transfer it to an inverted parchment-lined pan, gently pulling it to the length of the pan or to the length of your baking stone. If it springs back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then gently pull it out again. Place 3 strips on the pan, and then prepare another pan and repeat with the remaining strips.\n\nScore the dough strips as for traditional baguettes, slashing the tops with 3 diagonal cuts. Because the dough is sticky, you may have to dip the razor blade, serrated knife or scissors in water between each cut. You may also omit the cuts if the dough isn't cooperating.\n\nTake one pan to the preheated oven and carefully slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the baking stone (depending on the direction of the stone, you may choose to slide the dough and parchment off the side of the sheet pan instead of off the end); or bake directly on the sheet pan.\n\nMake sure the pieces aren't touching (you can reach in and straighten the parchment or the dough strips, if need be). Pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan and close the door.\n\nAfter 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, reduce the oven setting to 475 F and continue baking.\n\nMeanwhile, dust the other pan of strips with flour, mist with spray oil, and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. If you don't plan to bake these strips within 1 hour, refrigerate the pan and bake later or the next day.\n\nThe bread should begin to turn golden brown within 8 or 9 minutes. If the loaves are baking unevenly at this point, rotate them 180 degrees. Continue baking 10 to 15 minutes more, or until the bread is a rich golden brown and the internal temperature registers at least 205 F.\n\nTransfer the hot breads to a cooling rack. They should feel very light, almost airy, and will cool in about 20 minutes.\n\nWhile these are cooling, you can bake the remaining loaves, remembering to remove the parchment from the oven and turn the oven up to 500 F or higher before baking the second round.\n\nMakes 6 baguettes, 6 to 8 pizzas, or one 17-by-12-inch focaccia.\n\nFOR PIZZA:\n\nHeavily flour the counter and gently transfer the fully fermented dough from the bowl to the counter with a plastic scraper that has been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you.\n\nDivide the dough by continually dipping the pastry scraper into water and cutting the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces. Gently round the pieces into balls, being careful not to punch down and expel any more gas than necessary. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and spray lightly with oil. Place the floured dough balls on the parchment. Mist them with spray oil, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and return the pan to the refrigerator, unless you plan to make the pizzas immediately. These pizza doughs will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. (You may also put them into the freezer in individual plastic bags, and keep them for up to three months.)\n\nRemove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before shaping and baking your pizza as you always do.\n\nFOR FOCACCIA:\n\nLine a 17-by-12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment. With floured hands, take the fully fermented dough from the bowl and continue with your focaccia-shaping instructions. Ferment at room temperature for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough rises and fills the pan, rising to about 1-inch thick. Continue your usual focaccia baking instructions.",

You’ll end up with more than you need; keep the rest in a jar for another dish.\n\nMelt the butter in a pan and add the onions, garlic, and parsnips. Cover and cook very gently for 10 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time. Don’t let them brown.\n\nThen add the flour and, to start with, about half a tablespoon of your spice mixture or curry powder. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring to stop it sticking. Add about half of the stock, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan until the liquid thickens slightly. Then add the rest of the stock, taste and add some more spices if it’s not spicy enough for you.\n\nSimmer gently till the parsnip is really soft — this will take about 20 minutes. Liquidise, taste, and adjust flavour and consistency with a little water if necessary, bearing in mind that the cream or yoghurt will soften the flavour.\n\nReheat without boiling, adding cream or yoghurt to taste, and serve with fried croutons and a scattering of chives.\n\nSpread the love",

This little resting time is the secret for producing crispy and flavourful kara-age.\n\nHaving fillets with the skin on is very important for this dish. Skin-on fillets can be hard to find, so if you’re having trouble you can debone a few chicken thigh cutlets or use wings instead.\n\nPlace a rack above half of your frying pot. It will help reduce mess when transferring the chicken in and out of the oil, and the radiated heat from the oil will continue to warm and cook the chicken. If you don’t have a rack placed above the oil, you may want to extend your cooking time by just 30 seconds or so to ensure the chicken is cooked through.\n\nYou may notice that the chicken starts to spit and sizzle more on the third fry, this is because the chicken is cooked and is now contracting and squeezing out the juices from the meat (the watery juices contacting with the oil is what is causing it to spit). If this is happening, the chicken is done and you can remove it from the oil immediately.",

		"directions": "For the ginger and spring onion oil, pound the ginger and salt to a rough paste with a heatproof mortar and pestle. Add the spring onion and pound lightly to combine. Heat the peanut oil in a small frypan until it is smoking then pour the hot oil over the ginger mixture. Stir, then set aside until ready to serve.\n\nFor the chilli sauce, pound the chilli, ginger, garlic, sugar and salt together in a mortar and pestle until very smooth. Pounding chilli can take some time so to speed up the process you can start it in a blender or food processor and pound to finish, or grate the ingredients into the mortar using a rasp grater. Add the boiling stock to the pounded mixture. You can vary the amount of stock depending on the consistency of the chilli sauce you’re after. Stir in the juice, then adjust the seasoning if necessary so that the balance of sweet, sour and salty tastes is pleasant. Heat the chicken oil in a small saucepan until hot, the pour over the chilli mixture and stir to combine.\n\nRemove the fat deposits from inside the cavity of the chicken, near the tail. Roughly chop the fat and place in a small frying pan over very low heat to render. Render the chicken fat, stirring occasionally for about an hour until you all the fat is rendered and the solids are crisp. Remove the solids and use them for another purpose. Reserve the chicken oil.\n\nTo begin poaching the chicken, pound the unpeeled ginger in a mortar and pestle and add to a large pot containing about 4 litres of water, along with the tops of the spring onions used for the ginger and spring onion oil. Add the salt and MSG or chicken stock powder (if using) and bring to the boil over high heat. Taste the water and adjust the amount of salt so that it tastes savoury and a little salty. Reduce the heat to very low and add the chicken to the pot. There should be enough water in the pot so that the chicken doesn’t touch the bottom of the pot, as that will cause the skin to tear. Lift the chicken in and out of the water a couple of times to change the liquid in the chicken’s cavity. If you have poultry hooks, use them to hang the chickens in the pot (see video below). The water should now be steaming but not bubbling. Keep the heat low at this level and cook the chicken for 45 minutes.\n\nUsing the poultry hook (or slotted ladle), carefully lift the chicken out of the pan, ensuring you don’t break the skin, and plunge into a large bowl or sink of salted iced water. Reserve the stock and stand the chicken in the iced water for at least 10 minutes, turning once. This will stop the cooking and give the skin its delicious gelatinous texture. Remove from the iced water and hang over a bowl or the sink to drain well. Rub the skin all over with the sesame oil. The chicken should be cooked very lightly, pink inside the bones and with a gelatinous skin.\n\nTo make the chicken rice, pound the garlic and eschallot (or onion) to roughly bruise with a mortar and pestle. Combine the rendered chicken oil with vegetable oil to make ½ a cup of oil. Heat in a wok over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger stir until starting to brown, then strain through a sieve. Reserve the oil and discard the solids. Place the rice in a rice cooker or heavy-based saucepan. Add about 1.2L of the reserved stock from the chicken (strained) and the reserved flavoured chicken oil (or use the proportions as indicated on your rice cooker). Tie the pandan leaves in a knot (if using) and add to the rice. If cooking in a pot, bring to the boil over high heat and continue to boil for about 5 minutes until the level of the liquid reaches the top of the rice, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan with a tight fitting lid and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and stand for another 10 minutes.\n\nFor the dressing, combine the ingredients with about half a cup of the stock from cooking the chicken. When the rice is ready, use a cleaver to slice and debone the chicken Chinese-style and pour the dressing over it. Scatter with the coriander sprigs, and serve with sliced cucumber, tomato and serve with the rice and sauces.\n\nFamily-style chicken rice.\n\nKey Tips for Hainanese Chicken Rice\n\nThe key to this whole dish is seasoning the stock. If you find the stock, chicken, rice or sauces taste a little insipid, it is because the stock is not correctly seasoned. Taste the stock after cooking the chicken, it should taste like a strongly savoury chicken stock. If it tastes weak, add a little more salt. You can also boost it with a dash of fish sauce if you like, or some MSG if you are not opposed to it. Alternatively, do as I mention in the video and cook 2 chickens at once.\n\nPlease don’t overcook the chicken. A slow, gentle simmer for 45 minutes will produce chicken with a very pale pink blush to the meat and the inside of the thigh bones should be bright pink. If they are brown or grey the chicken is over cooked. That’s OK, but the texture will not quite be right.\n\nOften in Singapore this will be served with thick black cooking caramel or kecap manis over the chicken, but I prefer the sesame dressing included here.\n\nWhen making the chilli sauce, look for the colour of the sauce, rather than following the recipe exactly. It should be a bright orange, and that colour will give you a good indication of the proportion of chilli to ginger and garlic. The heat of the sauce should depend on the kind of chillies used, not the amount. The flavour of chilli in this sauce is more important than the heat.",

Knead on medium speed until dough is smooth, about 5 minutes. Add butter, a piece at a time, fully incorporating into dough before adding the next piece, until dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic, about 4 minutes.\n\nCoat a large bowl with nonstick spray and transfer dough to bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n\nIf making rolls, lightly coat a 6-cup jumbo muffin pan with nonstick spray. Turn out dough onto a floured surface and divide into 6 pieces. Divide each piece into 4 smaller pieces (you should have 24 total). They don’t need to be exact; just eyeball it. Place 4 pieces of dough side-by-side in each muffin cup. If making loaves, lightly coat two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans with nonstick spray. Turn out dough onto a floured surface and divide into 12 pieces. Nestle pieces side-by-side to create 2 rows down length of each pan. If making split-top buns, lightly coat two 9- by 13-inch baking dishes with nonstick spray. Divide dough into 12 pieces and shape each into a 4-inch long log. Place 6 logs in a row down length of each dish.\n\nLet shaped dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size (dough should be just puffing over top of pan), about 1 hour.\n\nPreheat oven to 375° F. Beat remaining egg with 1 teaspoon. water in a small bowl to blend. Brush top of dough with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt, if desired. Bake, rotating pan halfway through, until bread is deep golden brown, starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, and is baked through, 25 to 35 minutes for rolls, 50 to 60 minutes for loaf, or 30 to 40 minutes for buns. If making buns, slice each bun down the middle deep enough to create a split-top. Let milk bread cool slightly in pan on a wire rack before turning out; let cool completely.",

		"directions": "Two key techniques for create thicker, creamier yogurt: hold the milk at 195 °F / 90 °C for ten minutes, and culture with our High-Low method. This method starts with a hot temperature to speed culturing and provide the most food-safe conditions, then switches to a low temperature to achieve a smooth, firm set.\n\nEquipment: Brød & Taylor Folding Proofer & Slow Cooker, thermometer, large spoon or whisk, glass mason jars or other heat-proof containers with a capacity of one quart / one liter or less. (To make yogurt in one large container instead of a group of mason jars, see our Greek yogurt recipe.) Everything that will touch the milk should be thoroughly clean and dry.\n\nTip: Whisking the milk to cover the surface with bubbles will prevent the milk from forming a skin during heating and cooling.\n\nCool Milk to 115 °F / 46 °C. Remove the milk from the heat and allow to cool to at least 115 °F / 46 °C. For faster cooling, place the container of milk in a pan or sink of cold tap water. While the milk is cooling, set up the Proofer with the wire rack in place and the temperature at 120 °F / 49 °C.\n\nAdd Yogurt to the Milk. Put the yogurt with live cultures into a small bowl. Gradually stir in enough of the warm milk to liquefy the mixture and mix until smooth. Then pour the liquefied culture back into the large container of milk and stir gently to distribute. Pour the milk into jars and place in the Proofer. Tip: For proper heat circulation and the most accurate culturing temperature, arrange the jars so that they are not directly over the center of the Proofer. Be certain there is no water in the water tray. The water tray is not needed for making yogurt. You can remove it from the Proofer, if you like or leave it in place but do not add water because it will affect temperature settings.\n\nCulture at 120 °F / 49 °C for an Hour, then Lower the Heat to 86 °F / 30 °C. Set a kitchen timer for one hour, then after that hour turn the Proofer down to 86 °F / 30 °C. It’s important not to let the yogurt remain at 120 °F / 49 °C for more than an hour in order to avoid the whey separation and lumpy texture that come from culturing too hot.\n\nCheck the Yogurt after Two Hours. Check the yogurt by gently tilting a jar to the side to see if the milk has set. If you have used a higher protein milk or a fast-acting culture, it may be ready in just 2 hours (one hour at 120 °F / 49 °C plus one at 86 °F / 30 °C). Most yogurts will take about 3-4 hours to set, or the yogurt can be cultured longer for more flavor and acidity. When the yogurt is ready, put it into the refrigerator and allow it to chill thoroughly. Be sure to reserve enough yogurt to start your next batch.\n\nGreek Yogurt\n\nStrained Greek yogurt can be made from Classic, Custard-Style, Lactose-Free, Goat or Soy yogurt. Or, we also have a recipe that’s specialized for making the best Greek yogurt with the most convenient process, it’s here.\n\nTo strain Greek yogurt, line a colander or strainer with several layers of cheesecloth, a clean tea towel or a large paper coffee filter. Set the strainer over a bowl and spoon or pour in the yogurt. Cover and refrigerate. Allow to strain for 3-4 hours for thick Greek-style yogurt, or overnight for the thickest possible texture.\n\nSpoon or pour yogurt into lined strainer, keeping the level of the yogurt below the rim. Cover and refrigerate.\n\nAfter 4-12 hours, uncover, lift strainer from bowl and refrigerate whey for another use. Gently roll yogurt out of filter into clean bowl.\n\nGreek Yogurt also makes a wonderful base for frozen desserts, it is featured in our Strawberry, Roasted Peach and Blueberry Frozen Yogurt Recipes.",

Using either a microwave or the stovetop, heat milk to 195 °F / 90 °C. If using the stovetop, stir frequently to prevent scorching. Hold the temperature of the milk above 195 °F / 90 °C for ten minutes.

		"directions": "Mix the yeast, sugar and warm water together in a bowl and let sit for 5 minuets. If the yeast float to the top and start to go foamy, that means they're alive and you're good to proceed. Put in one cup of flour and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, mix until it comes together, flour your hands and start kneading. Keep adding flour as needed to keep the dough from being untenably sticky, but don't add too much; it should be pretty wet and sticky at the end. Knead until you can stretch it out thin without it tearing. Form the dough into a smooth ball, coat it and the inside of the bowl with olive oil, cover, and let rise — either for at least 24 hours in the fridge, or 1-2 hours at room temperature — until doubled in size.\n\nIn a 10-inch cast iron pan (or 10-inch Teflon pan), pour in enough olive oil to coat the bottom well. Put in a pinch of cornmeal, a little oregano, lots of black pepper and a small pinch of salt. Mix that together with your fingers and spread the seasoned oil around the bottom, corners and edges of the pan. Before you wash your hands, grab the risen dough ball and stretch it out a little wider than the pan. Put it in the pan, and let ir proof in there for a half hour, until puffy.\n\nFor the sauce, combine the tomatoes with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of sugar, and a few torn leaves of fresh basil. Make sure your cheese is ready and kept cold in the fridge.\n\nPut the pan on your largest burner. Turn the burner on medium and your oven's broiler (grill) on high. Spoon the sauce onto the dough and spread it edge to edge. After the heat has been on for about 5 minutes, sprinkle the pizza with parmesan and then the mozzarella, edge to edge. Put on the jalapeño slices (or any other toppings, or not), and get ready to transfer the pizza to the oven. It's hard to tell when the right moment is — in my cast iron pan, 7-8 minutes from the time I turn on the burner is the perfect time, but it takes practice. The best indicator may be your nose — the second you smell something starting to burn, move the pizza. Broil it on a high rack until the top is brown to your liking, 4-5 minutes.\n\nRemove the pizza and let it cool in the pan until firm. Use a butter knife to release the rim of browned cheese from the pan, and then pull the pizza out with tongs. The bottom may stick a bit — you can either try to scrape under there to release it, or simple tear it off with the tongs, it should be solid enough after cooling down to come out intact.",

		"directions": "1. Wash oranges and wipe them dry. Cut each Seville orange in half, crosswise around the equator. Set a non-reactive mesh strainer over a bowl and squeeze the orange halves to remove the seeds, assisting with your fingers to remove any stubborn ones tucked deep within.\n\n2. Tie the seeds up in cheesecloth or muslin very securely.\n\n3. Cut each rind into 3 pieces and use a sharp chef’s knife to cut the rinds into slices or cubes as thin as possible. Each piece shouldn’t be too large (no more than a centimeter, or 1/3-inch in length.) Cut the navel orange into similar-sized pieces.\n\n4. In a large (10-12 quart/liter) stockpot, add the orange slices, seed pouch, water, and salt, as well as the juice from the Seville oranges from step #1. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and cook until the peels are translucent, about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n(At this point, sometimes I’ll remove it from the heat after cooking them and let the mixture stand overnight, to help the seeds release any additional pectin.)\n\n5. Stir the sugar into the mixture and bring the mixture to a full boil again, then reduce heat to a gentle boil. Stir occasionally while cooking to make sure it does not burn on the bottom. Midway during cooking, remove the seed pouch and discard.\n\n6. Continue cooking until it has reached the jelling point, about 218ºF degrees (103ºC), if using a candy thermometer. I cook this slightly less than other jams and marmalades because the high amount of pectin helps the marmalade set up more stiffly. To test the marmalade, turn off the heat and put a small amount on a plate that has been chilled in the freezer and briefly return it to the freezer. Check it in a few minutes; it should be slightly jelled and will wrinkle just a bit when you slide your finger through it. If not, continue to cook until it is.\n\n7. Remove from heat, then stir in the Scotch (if using), and ladle the mixture into clean jars. Sometimes I bury a piece of vanilla bean in each jar. (Which is a great way to recycle previously-used or dried-out vanilla beans.)\n\nI don’t process my jams, since I store them in the refrigerator. But if you wish to preserve them by canning, you can read more about the process here.",

Fill the inside with the crushed potatoes and onions and add the bay leaves and rosemary. Rub a little salt over the skin and roast for 30 minutes.\n\nWhen the tin fills with juices from the duck, baste the potatoes. Drop the temp to 200C. Pour the Marsala into the tray and continue to roast for another 30-40 minutes until the skin is crisp and the flesh is brown and moist.\n\nLift the duck and potatoes out onto another baking tray or plate, cover with foil and rest for about 20 minutes. Pour the left over juices into a saucepan over a medium heat and sprinkle the tablespoon of flour into it to thicken the gravy up, when it starts to colour, add a little more Marsala and the ladle of stock or water. Simmer until thickened, taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nTake to the table with the roast potatoes surrounding it, and the gravy in a serving jug. I also served lightly boiled broccoli with melting butter with my roast, it’s up to you what you want to serve with it!",

		"description": "Equilibrium brining is a technique commonly used to flavor proteins like chicken or pork33. However, few cooks, if anyone, have used this method for eggs, and the technique’s results are very effective. \n\nThe technique treats the brine as the general flavor and salinity you want your brined item to be, not more or less. Like the previous method, diffusion is still involved, and eventually everything would reach equilibrium, where no more seasoning is diffusing into the egg. However, the salt content is very high in that method’s brine, and that salt would not only overseason the egg at equilibrium but would destroy the proteins in the process, creating something far from delicious. \n\nBy contrast, this equilibrium method takes the guesswork out of knowing when to pull the eggs and creates a consistent edge to edge seasoned egg with no grainy yolks. And that’s reflected in the final egg’s appearance and taste. In this method, the egg white is uniformly seasoned throughout, and the yolk is lightly cured, firming into a clear and fully seasoned gel. \n\nWhile this technique might seem more technical, it’s still simple. You just need a scale and patience. Based on my experimentation, these eggs will be perfect anywhere from 1 to 4 days after being placed in the brine with no loss in quality. The only real downside is that you have to wait around 1-4 days before they’ll be ready. Which… y’know… some of us don’t like to wait, I get it. Physics doesn’t make exceptions for any of us, unfortunately. Still, I think patience is a virtue, and these are delicious and easy. ",

		"directions": "1.\t In the container you will also soak the eggs in, weigh your peeled eggs. Add water to cover completely, and record the total weight of the eggs and water. \n\n1.\tFor instance, if I have 3 cooked and peeled eggs that weigh 150 grams, and I cover them completely with 350 grams of water, I'd have 500 grams total.\n\n2.\tAdd in 10% of this weight in soy sauce, and 8% in mirin. \n\n1.\tIf in the example above, since your eggs and water weighs 500 grams, you’d add in 50 grams of soy sauce, and 40 grams of mirin. \n\n3.\tSoak in the fridge for at least 24 hours, and reserve in the brine until needed. Anywhere from 1-3 days, these will be excellent. If left in the brine for longer, the egg begins to degrade in quality over time. I’ve found that anything longer than 5 days and the egg’s exterior will feel soft and somewhat crumbly. ",

		"directions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Beat together all of the dough ingredients, using the flat beater paddle of your stand mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle. If you're using a stand mixer, beat the mixture for 4 to 5 minutes at medium-high speed, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl twice. The mixture should start to become smooth and a bit shiny.\n\nSwitch to the dough hook, and knead the dough at medium speed for 7 minute, stopping to scrape the dough into a ball twice; it may or may not start to clear the sides of the bowl on its own. If you're using a bread machine, let it go through its entire kneading cycle, but don't let it rise; continue with step 3, below.\n\nScrape the dough into a ball, and place it in a lightly greased bowl or large (greased) plastic bag. Refrigerate overnight, or for up to 24 hours.\n\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator, divide it in half, and shape it into two 9\" logs. Place them each in a lightly greased 9\" x 5\" loaf pan.\n\nCover the pans with clear shower caps (first choice) or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise until it's crowned about 1\" over the rim of the pan. Since the dough is cold, this will take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 175C (normal), 160C (fan). \n \nBake the loaves for 25 minutes. Tent with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until the bread is a deep golden brown, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one of the loaves registers at least 190°F.\n\nRemove the bread from the oven, and place the pans on a rack. After 5 minutes, gently turn the loaves out onto the rack to cool completely.\n\nStore, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for several days, or up to a week in cool/dry weather; for longer storage, wrap well and freeze.\n\nTips from our Bakers\n\nWant to make just a single loaf? Halve all the ingredients except the yeast; use 2 teaspoons instant yeast.\n\nWe don't advise kneading this dough by hand; it's extremely sticky. If you don't have a stand mixer or bread machine, make enough dough for just one loaf, and try beating the dough with a hand mixer.\n\nWant to make this bread with the help of your bread machine? Place the dough ingredients into your machine in the order listed and choose the dough or manual cycle. When the cycle is done, remove the risen dough and shape and bake as directed in the recipe above. Note: Due to the many brands of bread machines on the market and their different features, we can’t guarantee you can bake this bread start to finish in your own machine; please use the dough or manual cycle instead.",

		"directions": "Start by marinating your beef. I like to do this overnight, but 4 or more hours should be sufficient.\n\nTo a small sauce pan, add the water, the garlic, and the 4 chili pods. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook for about 20 minutes or until the pods are softened. Let the mixture cool. Take the pods, garlic, and about a cup of the water and blend until you have a fine puree. Pour this mixture into a sealable bag, throw in a generous pinch or two of salt, and add in the beef, seal, and give the beef a nice massage to ensure the marinade penetrates the beef. Place in the refrigerator until you are ready to grill.\n\nWhen you are ready to start making this, you have a couple of options. First is to grill the vegetables and beef (which is what I prefer), or you can cook everything in one big wok or skillet. (Hint: chose the grill)\n\nHeat up your grill. I like to use a combination of charcoal and cherry wood as the smokiness really gets into the great flavor of the beef.\n\nWhile the grill heats up, add the bacon to a large skillet, and cook on low heat, adding about 1/4 cup of water during the cooking process. You don’t want the bacon to be fully crisp as you normally might eat for breakfast, but somewhere between soft and crisp. Continue cooking the bacon on low heat, reserving some of the fat.\n\nNext, add the whole bell peppers, onion, and jalapeno peppers to the grill, cooking over the coals. Your goal here is to get a nice char, while not fully cooking the peppers. Once you get a bit of the char, remove them from the grill, and take them inside to slice. Remove any of the seeds from the jalapenos if you don’t want this to be spicy.\n\nOnce you slice the peppers, and onion, add them to the cooked bacon, along with the sliced tomatoes and cilantro. Give this a good stir, and season with a pinch or two of salt.\n\nReturn back to the grill, and cook your beef until it is about medium. Don’t overcook your beef!\n\nTake the beef inside, and slice into 1 inch strips, then add the beef to the bacon mixture, giving a good stir.\n\nTop the mixture with the Oaxaca cheese, then cover, and remove from the heat. You want the cheese to melt into the mixture.\n\nNow you are ready to serve. Uncover, and place the skillet onto some heat resistant pads on the table. Top with fresh limes and sliced avocados, along with a plate of warmed flour tortillas.\n\nTake your tortilla, take some of the alambre, and fold it into the tortilla. Give a squeeze of fresh lime juice, lay on some avocado, and some sour cream if you prefer, and dig in.",

Drop 8-10 pretzel bites into water and let boil for a quick 10 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or spatula and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Make sure the bites aren’t touching.\n\nBrush beaten egg over each pretzel bite. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake batches for 15 minutes each, or until golden brown.\n\nRemove from oven and serve with spicy nacho cheese sauce or honey mustard. Pretzel bites remain fresh for up to 3 days in an airtight container, though they will lose some softness.",

		"description": "Ivan Ramen chicken stock is made of whole chickens and water—that’s it.\n\nEasy enough, but that also means you should skip those stinky, factory-farmed birds and look for free-range or pasture-raised ones. You’ll pay more, but if the only flavor component in this soup is chicken, it’s worth paying for chickens that taste good. Buy a whole chicken if you can manage it—meaning with head and feet attached. There’s lots of flavor in the ugly bits, along with collagen that gives body to the stock. If you can’t find a whole chicken, buy a couple of chicken feet, wash them thoroughly, and throw them in the pot along with the neck and any other parts that come with your bird.\n\nAside from the quality of the chicken, there are two crucial factors in the success of this soup. The first is maintaining the ratio of water to chicken: there should be twice as much water as chicken by volume, and the liquid level should be maintained over the entire cooking time. The second is temperature. Invest in a thermometer and be vigilant—try to keep the liquid around 176°F (80°C) for the first hour of cooking. This might seem fussy to Americans, and you can just keep it at a gentle simmer if you don’t want to monitor the temperature, but very specific temperatures are a hallmark of Japanese soups and stocks. I’ve made enough soup to tell you confidently that 176°F (80°C) is the right temperature for this stock.",

		"directions": "1. Stick your hands into the cavity of the bird and scoop out the giblets and liver, if present. (If you buy from a butcher, you can ask them to do this.) Rinse the bird thoroughly under cold running water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Then trim as much fat as possible from the chicken and reserve.\n2. Put the chicken in a large stockpot, along with any giblets, livers, or hearts that came with it. Add enough water (about 5 liters/5 quarts for a 2-kilo/4½-pound bird) to achieve a ratio of about 1 part chicken to 2 parts water by volume. The chicken should be fully submerged in water. Note how far the water level is from the top of the pot. This pot sits on the fire for 6 hours, and you’ll want to keep the water at the same level the whole time to yield a light, clean stock.\n3. Over medium heat, heat the water to 176°F (80°C); the water won’t be simmering or bubbling, but too hot for you to hold your finger in for more than a second. Keep the water as close to that temperature as possible for 1 hour. Add water as needed to maintain the water level.\n4. After an hour, raise the heat to high and bring the liquid to a slow boil. With a slotted spoon or skimmer, skim all the scum that comes to the surface. When the liquid is clear, pull the bird to the surface with a pair of tongs and very carefully give it a good whack with a wooden spoon. Skim every bit of resulting scum until the stock is completely clear of detritus.\n5. Once you’ve finished skimming, add the reserved chicken fat to the pot. Lower the heat back to a medium simmer and keep that simmer for the next 5 hours, stirring the pot every 20 minutes and adding water as necessary to maintain the water level. After about 2½ hours, the bird should begin to break down a bit. Press on it with a wooden spoon to help it fall apart. This will extract more flavor into the broth. After 5 hours, the bones and flesh will have mostly fallen apart. Turn off the heat.\n6. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the meat and bones. Cool the stock, then refrigerate. Once cool, skim the congealed chicken fat from the surface and reserve it for when you need schmaltz for your ramen. Store the stock in an airtight container until you’re ready to use it; it will keep for about 1 week in the refrigerator and 1 month in the freezer.",

		"description": "I think it’s possible that every kid of the ’80s and maybe the ’90s made tiffin as a child. It is the ultimate recipe to keep young hands busy for an hour during the summer holidays. Joyously unfussy with no real technique to speak of – it’s basically melt and mix. For my version, I have kept things pretty much as they always are, but I’ve soaked the fruit in alcohol because I’m an adult now and it sounded good to me (but exclude this for children). I have also added a little hint of malt flavour, which is such a wonderful pairing with chocolate.",

Set aside.\n\nPlace the butter, golden syrup (or honey), vanilla and salt into a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Add the two types of chocolate and the Ovaltine and stir constantly until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and add the biscuits and raisins, stirring so that everything is coated in chocolate. Scrape the mixture into the prepared tin and spread into an even layer. Refrigerate the tiffin for a few hours, or until firm.\n\nTo serve, remove the tiffin from the tin and cut into pieces. You can serve them as is, or you can give them a little flair and dust with cocoa or drizzle with a little melted white chocolate, or if you’re like me, you can do both.\n\nStore in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days (the biscuit element will slowly soften over time).\n\nNOTE If you can’t find Ovaltine, you can use Horlicks or malt powder, but the flavour isn’t as pronounced.\n\n",

		"description": "A warm scone is an object of extraordinary comfort, but even more so when it has potato in it. The farl, a slim scone of flour, butter and mashed potato, is rarely seen nowadays and somehow all the more of a treat when it is. I have taken the idea and run with it, mashing steamed pumpkin into the hand-worked crumbs of flour and butter to make a bread that glows orange when you break it. Soft, warm and floury, this is more than welcome for a Sunday breakfast in winter or a tea round the kitchen table.\n\nCooked initially in a frying pan and then finished in the oven, I love this with grilled Orkney bacon and slices of cheddar sharp enough to make my lips smart – a fine contrast for the sweet, floury \"scone\" and its squishy centre.",

You could do this in a food processor, but it hardly seems worth the washing up.\n\nCrush the pumpkin with a potato masher, then beat in the egg, followed by the milk and thyme leaves. Scoop this into the flour mixture and mix well. Season with black pepper.\n\nWarm a heavy, non-stick frying pan with a metal handle over a low to moderate heat. Melt a little oil or butter in it, then pile in the dough and smooth it flat. Leave to cook over a low heat till the underside is pale gold.\n\nLightly oil a dinner plate. Loosen the underside of the scone with the help of a palette knife. Put the plate over the top of the pan, then, holding the plate in place, tip the pan so that the scone falls on to the plate. Slide the scone back into the frying pan and cook the other side for 4 or 5 minutes. Put the pan in the oven for 7 minutes or until the scone is lightly set in the middle.\n\nTurn the scone out of the pan and slice into thick wedges. Serve warm, with cheese or some grilled bacon.",

Stand for at least 10 minutes, then strain, discarding the shells and reserving the stock. Devein and butterfly the prawns and refrigerate.\n\nBlend all the laksa rempah ingredients into a smooth paste, adding a little of the dried shrimp steeping liquid if you need to help the blades catch. Any remaining steeping liquid can be combined with the prawn stock.\n\nHeat a large saucepan over medium heat and add a little oil for the prawn oil. Fry the remaining prawn heads and shells until very fragrant, then add the salt and remaining oil and cook on low heat for about 10 minutes. Certain varieties of prawns have more red colour than others, so if your prawn shells are not very red and you prefer a more vibrant red oil you can add a little tomato paste when frying the prawn heads. Strain to remove remove the heads and shells, reserving the oil.\n\nHeat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot (you can use the prawn oil for this if you like, or save it for adding later). Add half the laksa rempah (refrigerate or freeze the rest for another laksa) and fry for about 10-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the oil separates from the paste. Add the prawn stock and bring to a simmer.\n\nStir in the salt, sugar, fish sauce and coconut milk and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the tofu puffs and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Simmer the prawns in the soup for 3 minutes, or until just cooked, then remove and set aside. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as required.\n\nWhile the soup is cooking, prepare the remaining ingredients. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the packet directions. Boil the fish cake for about 2 minutes, or until puffed, then drain. Blanch the bean sprouts for 30 seconds. Boil the eggs for 7 minutes, then refresh in a basin of iced water and peel. Halve the eggs.\n\nFor the chilli sambal, blend all the chillies together with the shallot and belacan. Heat a small saucepan over medium heat and fry the paste in the peanut oil for about 10 minutes, or until very fragrant, stirring frequently. Stir in the sugar and set aside for serving.\n\nTo assemble each laksa, warm a noodle bowl. Add some hokkien noodles, vermicelli, bean sprouts, egg, and prawn to the bowl. Ladle in some soup, then garnish with Vietnamese mint, cucumber and a big spoon of chilli sambal. Serve immediately.",

		"directions": "For Roasted Banana Ice Cream:\n\n4 ripe bananas (they should be at least yellow with a few spots, but even better when overripe.) – Place the bananas on a Silicone Baking Mat\n\nor foil covered Baking Sheet with sides, which will catch the juices. Poke small holes in the peels and bake at 350°F for about 40-60 minutes, depending on how ripe the bananas are.\n\n*See below for ideas of ingredients to mash into the frozen ice cream.\n\nTo make the Vanilla Base:\n\nHeat the heavy cream, milk, vanilla bean and sugar in a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat. The longer you let this mixture sit, the stronger the vanilla flavor will be. I often bring the mixture to a simmer, turn off the heat and let it steep for an hour or so. Before you continue with the recipe, you will need to bring it back to a simmer.\n\nWhisk together the yolks in a medium sized bowl. Remove the cream mixture from the heat and whisk a small amount of the cream into the egg mixture. Add enough cream to warm the eggs.\n\nOnce the eggs are warm, add them back into the pot of remaining cream.\n\nUse a rubber spatula to gently stir the custard over low heat. Continue stirring until the mixture starts to thicken.\n\nWhen the custard seems to be getting thicker, lift the rubber spatula and run your finger through it. It is done when the custard clings to the spatula.\n\nStrain the custard through a fine mesh Strainer\n\nor Chinois into a shallow dish. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and immediately place in the refrigerator.\n\nAllow the custard to “ripen” for 6 to 12 hours for the best result. If you are in a rush, at least make sure the custard is thoroughly chilled. As you can see above that the custard will be quite thick once it has chilled.\n\nIf you want vanilla ice cream freeze this custard in an Ice Cream Maker\n\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nTo make roasted banana ice cream:\n\nPuree the roasted bananas in a food processor or using an immersion blender. It will make about 1 cup of puree.\n\nMake sure the banana puree is chilled before adding it to the vanilla ice cream base.\n\nMake sure the custard is smooth. Freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nFreeze a bowl and have it ready for the freshly made ice cream. Immediately freeze the ice cream to harden.\n\n*Once your banana ice cream is done you can have fun mashing other ingredients into it. In this bowl I have added toasted pecans and a drizzle of maple syrup. You can do this to the entire batch or just an individual bowl.\n\nSpread the top of the banana ice cream with a thin layer of chocolate ganache.\n\nAs you scoop the ice cream out of the bowl the ganache will swirl into it….\n\nand add a wonderful chocolate fudge flavor.\n\nI also soaked 1/2 cup dried cherries in 1 tablespoons brandy during the time it took to freeze the ice cream.\n\nThen I strained the excess liquid off of the cherries and mixed them into the ice cream.\n\n*While I was in college at the University of Vermont, I worked at Ben & Jerry’s making the ice cream cakes. As a Vermonter I have a fondness for their ice cream and one of my favorite flavors is Chunky Monkey. If you mix all the nuts, chocolate and cherries together you can create a new version of this magnificent classic.",

You may have to turn your burner up and down to keep the temperature constant. Mixture will thicken to the consistency of gravy.\n\nRemove from heat and let cool. Mixture will continue to thicken.\n\nLine a sieve with a clean tea towel or several layers of cheesecloth and set over a bowl.

Add all dry ingredients in a large 1 gallon ziplock bag and shake to mix well. Add chicken pieces to bag with 1 tbs olive oil, seal bag and shake for a minute, massaging the seasoning to cover all the pieces of chicken. When Instant Pot reads “hot”, use tongs and carefully add the pieces of chicken. Don’t force all the pieces to fit, do 2 batches. Let the chicken sear for 2-3 minutes and then carefully flip the pieces and do the other side for another 2-3 minutes. Remove to plate when done and proceed with 2nd batch.\n\nAfter all the chicken is browned, pour 1/2 cup of broth into the pot and use a wooden spoon to scrape all the bits from the bottom. Don’t skip this step, it’s important. Once the bottom is scraped up, add the other cup of broth, the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Then add chicken. Squeeze all the chicken in as best you can – most should be covered with the liquid, but not all. Secure lid, set vent to “sealing” and pressure cook on high for 15 minutes. When cooking time is done, allow pressure to naturally release for at least 10 minutes.\n\nOnce pressure is released and pin drops, carefully remove lid. Use tongs and remove chicken to a separate bowl. Add about 1/4 cup of the juices from the Instant Pot and use 2 forks to shred chicken.\n\nYou’er ready to add your favorite BBQ sauce (probably about 1/2 cup), but you can just add more of the juices from the pot – the taste of that alone is unbelievable!\n\nServe on warm brioche or other rolls and enjoy!",

When the water is boiling add the tomatoes for 30-60 seconds. Remove immediately and place in a cold water bath (a bowl filled with ice and cold water). The skin will peel right off of the tomatoes.\n\nFirst Blend: Cut out the cores of the tomatoes and add all the rest to your blender. Blend at high-speed for about 30 seconds until the tomatoes are broken down.\n\nAdd bread: Take all of the \"guts\" out of your baguette and add them to the blended tomatoes. The baguette should have given about 2-3 cups of guts and you can experiment with how much you add, as this is how you change the texture. I use about 2 cups of the bread guts. Let the bread soak in the tomato juice for about 5 minutes.\n\nSecond Blend: Add the splash of vinegar, salt, and garlic and blend until the soup is an even texture and the bread is completely broken down.\n\nAdd Oil: If your blender has it, open the small hole in the top. Slowly add the olive oil as you are blending at a moderate speed. If it doesn't have the hole, stop and go adding little by little.\n\nAdd Egg and Adjust: Add 1 hardboiled egg and blend until incorporated. Taste and adjust levels of salt, vinegar, garlic, and bread.\n\nServe and Enjoy: Serve in small bowls with diced hardboiled egg and sliced ham as condiments. Serve cold! Enjoy!",

		"description": "If you’re unfamiliar with unohana, this modest-looking mixture of savory soy milk lees (okara) studded with vegetables may appear mysterious. But nibble on some with beer and sake or enjoy it as a homey side dish, and you’ll find this old-fashioned Japanese preparation to be very agreeable.\n\nThe cooking process requires an initial dry-roasting to parch the okara, which are then cooked with vegetables, dashi stock, and seasonings. The lees absorb the flavors of their companions, and the layering of the stock, sake, mirin, and soy sauce results in a flavorful mixture.\n\nWash and scrape the root vegetables to retain their earthiness. Feel free to substitute other kinds of fresh mushroom, even non-Asian ones. Chopped green beans or thawed lima beans are worthy stand-ins for the edamame.",

		"directions": "1 Crumble up the soy milk lees if they are extremely compact. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat, then add the lees. Cook the lees, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes, until they have gone from being damp clumps to a fluffy fine mixture, like fresh breadcrumbs. Incorporate any crusty bits that form at the bottom and sides of the skillet. Wisps of steam may waft from the skillet.\n\n2 Add the leek, root vegetables, mushrooms, and edamame. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring, until you can smell the vegetables. Pour in the dashi and sake and give the pan a stir to combine. Let things bubble and hiss for about 5 minutes to allow the liquids to cook and season the vegetables and lees. Stir the skillet to ensure even cooking.\n\nThe liquid will evaporate and be absorbed during this cooking period. The lees will firm up to resemble a soft mashed mixture. Keep stirring until the root vegetables are tender-crisp and the mushrooms are soft, adding dashi or water by the tablespoon to further cook, if needed.\n\n3 Add the mirin and soy sauce, stirring for about 2 minutes, until the liquid is no longer visible and the vegetables have just cooked through. Aim for a mixture that is moist but not wet.\n\nRemove the skillet from the heat and set aside to cool completely and develop the flavors. After about 10 minutes, give it a taste and add a smidgen of mirin and/or soy sauce, if needed.\n\nServe as mounded portions in small, individual dishes for each guest. Refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days and return to room temperature before serving.",

The pumpkin should be tender in 12-15 minutes. Remove from the heat.\n\nChop the chillies, removing the seeds first if you wish, peel the garlic and ginger and chop roughly. Put them all into a food processor. Discard the outer leaves of the lemon grass and roughly chop the inner leaves, shred the lime leaves, then add them to the chillies. Scrub the coriander roots and add them to the chillies, along with half the coriander leaves and stems. Blitz them to a pulp, adding a little vegetable oil if the mixture needs it to go round.\n\nPlace a fairly deep pan over a moderate heat, add half the spice paste (keep the other half in the fridge for tomorrow) and fry it, moving it round the pan so it does not scorch. Do this for 1-2 minutes, then pour in the stock and coconut milk and bring to the boil.\n\nCut the tomatoes in half and add them to the soup with the nam pla and lemon juice. They will take 7-10 minutes to cook. Add the chunks of pumpkin and continue cooking for a minute or two. Place a swirl of cooked noodles in each of four bowls, pour over the laksa and add the mint and the remaining coriander leaves.",

		"directions": "ChefSteps cooks sous vide with Joule, the sous vide tool created by our in-house team of chefs, designers, and engineers. Compact and gorgeous, Joule is a WiFi-connected device you control easily with your smartphone. Learn more about Joule and sous vide, and you’ll be whipping up amazing feasts like this in no time.\n\nUse this simple technique to find potatoes ideal for frying.\n\nPeel the potatoes, and place them in water to slow browning.\n\nCut peeled potatoes into batons 9 mm thick.\n\nSubmerge in water to keep them from browning.\n\nCombine water, salt, glucose syrup, and baking soda to prepare a brine.\n\nHOME-COOK HACK: Don’t have glucose syrup lying around? We get it. Substitute granulated sugar for a similar effect—2.5 g granulated sugar for every 10 g glucose syrup. (The idea here is basically to emulate the natural sweetness in the potato. We’ve found that glucose does this best, but regular sugar works too.)\n\nPackage fries with an equal weight of brine. Vacuum-seal bag or hang open edge over the side and clip in place. Space fries in one even layer within the sealed bag.\n\nNOTE: Using smaller batch sizes (about 500 g) will make it easier to handle fries without breaking them.\n\nCook fries sous vide until very tender, about 15 minutes. This ensures that the insides will be light and fluffy after frying.\n\nNOTE: Cooking the fries at this temperature reduces the risk of overcooking some fries before others have fully cooked. For best results, cook potatoes until they are nearly—but not quite—falling apart.\n\nGently remove fries from the bag. Lay them on a wire rack, not touching each other, to cool them and let their surfaces dry.\n\nCHEF’S TIP: If you have access to a chamber vacuum sealer, place the rack of hot fries into the chamber and pull a vacuum. The falling pressure will cause water at the surface to quickly evaporate, cooling the fries and drying out the surface for a crisper crust. This is the technique Heston Blumenthal used at The Fat Duck to make his famous Triple-Cooked Chips.\n\nFill a large pot about halfway with oil and heat to 266 °F / 130 °C.\n\nTIP: Use enough oil to ensure that the temperature doesn’t drop too far when the cold fries are added, and be sure the pot is large enough to keep the oil from boiling over as the potatoes fry.\n\nWorking with small batches, carefully lower the fries into the hot oil with a strainer or slotted spoon.\n\nFry for about five minutes, or until the surface begins to feel dry and firm to the touch when the fries are lifted out of the oil.\n\nRemove fries from oil, and lay them out on a wire rack to cool and dry.\n\nPlace in the freezer.\n\nAt this point, the fries can be stored for several months frozen. When you’re ready to serve, continue to the next step.\n\nNOTE: To avoid rancidity, vacuum-pack the fries after they’re frozen, being careful not to crush them.\n\nHeat a large pot of oil to 374 °F / 190 °C.\n\nTIP: Again, use enough oil to ensure that the temperature doesn’t drop too far when the cold fries are added, and be sure the pot is large enough to keep the oil from boiling over as the potatoes fry.\n\nFry for about 1 minute 45 seconds, or until the surface appears golden brown and bubbles streaming from the fries slow to a trickle, which indicates that the crust is dry and crisp.\n\nDrain fries on paper towels to remove excess oil. This will prevent the crust from absorbing oil and becoming greasy as the fries cool.\n\nSeason fries with finely ground salt and black pepper to taste.",

		"directions": "Dolma\n\nUse the larger and thicker leaves to line the bottom of the Instant Pot. This helps to prevent the dolma from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning. These leaves don't need to be blanched.\n\nBoil a pot of water, while you prepare the grape leaves by washing them thoroughly. Stack leaves in groups of 10. Using tongs, dip one stack of grape leaves at a time into boiling water and flip when their color begins to change from bright green to olive. This can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Drape the leaves over the edge of a colander to drain. Repeat with the remaining leaves until all the leaves have been blanched.\n\nWash and rinse rice and add to a large bowl. Add chopped onion, garlic, dill, and parsley. Top with tomato paste, and spices. Mix thoroughly to combine. Make sure there are no clumps of tomato paste left.\n\nAdd meat, lemon juice, and olive oil. Mix until the ingredients are incorporated.\n\nLay grape leaves on a flat surface with the spines facing up and smooth side down. Add approximately one tablespoon of filling to the center of each leaf. Fold the sides over the filling and roll the leaf from the bottom up.\n\nAdd the dolma into the Instant Pot bowl in rows. Do not overcrowd, as the rice will expand as it cooks. Sprinkle each row with dillweed (optional). I ended up with four rows containing 25, 30, 30, and 25 dolmas.\n\nPrepare Dolma Cooking Sauce\n\nWhisk the sauce ingredients into a small saucepan and bring to a boil.\n\nPour the sauce carefully over the dolma. Cover the Instant Pot with the lid and set the vent to Seal. Select High Pressure and set the cooking time to 20 minutes. It will take approximately 10 minutes to come to pressure. When the time is up, do a Natural Release for 15 minutes then release the remaining pressure if necessary.\n\nSpicy Red Sauce\n\nHeat oil in the same saucepan used to make the dolma sauce. Add onion and cook until translucent. Add tomato paste and cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle with paprika, cayenne, and continue to stir until combined. Cook for a few more minutes.\n\nFinally, add the water and mix until smooth. Turn down the heat and simmer for an additional five to ten minutes\n\nYogurt Sauce\n\nWhile the dolma is cooking, mix the yogurt, garlic, dill, salt, and citric acid. Chill until ready to serve.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nAllow the stuffed grape leaves to rest for 15 minutes so that they don't fall apart when being served. Carefully add dolma to a plate. Cover with yogurt sauce and the spicy red sauce. Serve with Pita Bread on the side.\n\nIf your pot comes to pressure and you get the \"burn\" error message, which seems to be an issue with some models, allow the dolma to cook for the same time suggested. The built-up pressure will still cook the dolma. Release the pressure 45 minutes from the time you started the Instant Pot.\n\nIf you're serving a large crowd or your family, place a flat platter over the Instant Pot bowl and quickly invert the bowl. This should dislodge all the dolma onto the platter. Then your family or guests can serve themselves, Iraqi style!\n\nWhen rolling the dolma, I like to roll five at a time. I lay five leaves out first, then add the filling, and finally roll all five, then repeat. It seems to speed up the process.\n\nIf you want to make this a vegetarian recipe, replace the meat with an additional cup of rice. You can also add some minced mushrooms.",

		"description": "My students often ask me to teach them how to make a cinnamon bun as good as the ones they get at the mall from Cinnabon and other franchise shops. For my money, this version makes a cinnamon bun that outperforms all the malls. But those of us who grew up in eastern Pennsylvania have a soft spot in our hearts for sticky buns, such as the ones originating from the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside. Frankly, everyone in the United States seems to have a favorite regional version, whether it is a cinnamon bun glazed with a sweet, white-sugar fondant or a sticky bun with a caramel glaze. Regardless of side issues, such as white versus caramel glazes, the type of nut (usually walnuts versus pecans), or with or without raisins, the real key to this kind of comfort food is a soft, light, tender, slightly sweet dough baked just right.\n\nThis formula falls in the enriched, not the rich, dough category because the fat content is slightly under 20 percent. I’ve made versions of sweet dough that do indeed contain up to 50 percent fat, but then why eat the buns? You might as well strap them right onto your hips, since that’s where they will end up (or, as one of my customers used to say, “They call them sticky buns because they stick to your buns!”). Between the shortening, eggs, sugar, and milk, there are plenty of enrichments to tenderize this dough without additional fat. However, if you do want to make a more decadent version of cinnamon or sticky buns, try the formula for Middle-Class Brioche.\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nThis dough can be used for other applications besides cinnamon and sticky buns. For instance, you can make thumbprint sweet rolls, filled with jam or jelly. You can also make pastry logs. Roll out the dough as you would for cinnamon buns, but instead of cutting pinwheel slices and baking them face up, load the logs with nuts, raisins, and cinnamon sugar and bake them whole, like bâtards. Slice them after they’ve cooled so all the goodies inside come tumbling out onto your plate.",

		"directions": "BREAD PROFILE:\n\n_Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast\n\n15 minutes mixing; 3¾ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 50 to 55 minutes baking_\n\n1. Cream together the sugar, salt, and shortening on medium-high speed in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a large metal spoon and mixing bowl and do it by hand); if you are using powdered milk, cream the milk with the sugar, but add the water with the flour and yeast. Whip in the egg and lemon extract until smooth. Then add the flour, yeast, and milk. Mix on low speed (or stir by hand) until the dough forms a ball. Switch to the dough hook and increase the speed to medium, mixing for approximately 10 minutes (or knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes), or until the dough is silky and supple, tacky but not sticky. You may have to add a little flour or water while mixing to achieve this texture. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.\n\n2. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.\n\n3. Mist the counter with spray oil and transfer the dough to the counter. Proceed as pictures. \n\nSHAPING CINNAMON BUNS AND STICKY BUNS\n\nRoll out the dough with a rolling pin, lightly dusting the top of the dough with flour to keep it from sticking to the pin. Roll it into a rectangle about ⅔ inch thick and 14 inches wide by 12 inches long for larger buns, or 18 inches wide by 9 inches long for smaller buns. Don’t roll out the dough too thin, or the finished buns will be tough and chewy rather than soft and plump.\n\nSprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the surface of the dough and roll the dough up into a cigar-shaped log, creating a cinnamon-sugar spiral as you roll.\n\nWith the seam side down, cut the dough into 8 to 12 even pieces each about 1¾ inches thick for larger buns; or 12 to 16 pieces each 1¼ inch thick for smaller buns.\n\n4. For cinnamon buns, line 1 or more sheet pans with baking parchment. Place the buns approximately ½ inch apart so that they aren’t touching but are close to one another. For sticky buns, coat the bottom of 1 or more baking dishes or baking pans with sides at least 1½ inches high with a ¼-inch layer of the caramel glaze. Sprinkle on the nuts and raisins. You do not need a lot of nuts and raisins, only a sprinkling. Lay the pieces of dough on top of the caramel glaze, spacing them about ½ inch apart. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.\n\n5. Proof at room temperature for 75 to 90 minutes, or until the pieces have grown into one another and have nearly doubled in size. You may also retard the shaped buns in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, pulling the pans out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours before baking to allow the dough to proof.\n\n6. Preheat the oven to 350°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf for cinnamon buns but on the lowest shelf for sticky buns.\n\n7. Bake the cinnamon buns for 20 to 30 minutes or the sticky buns for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. If you are baking sticky buns, remember that they are really upside down (regular cinnamon buns are baked right side up), so the heat has to penetrate through the pan and into the glaze to caramelize it. The tops will become the bottoms, so they may appear dark and done, but the real key is whether the underside is fully baked. It takes practice to know just when to pull the buns out of the oven.\n\n8. For cinnamon buns, cool the buns in the pan for about 10 minutes and then streak white fondant glaze across the tops while the buns are warm but not too hot. Remove the buns from the pans and place them on a cooling rack. Wait at least 20 minutes before serving. For sticky buns, cool the buns in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes and then remove them by flipping them over onto another pan. Carefully scoop any run-off glaze back over the buns with a spatula. Wait at least 20 minutes before serving.\n\n**White Fondant Glaze for Cinnamon Buns**\n\nCinnamon buns are usually topped with a thick white glaze called fondant. There are many ways to make fondant glaze, but here is a delicious and simple version, enlivened by the addition of citrus flavor, either lemon or orange. You can also substitute vanilla extract or rum extract, or simply make the glaze without any flavorings.\n\nSift 4 cups of powdered sugar into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon or orange extract and between 6 tablespoons to ½ cup of warm milk, briskly whisking until all the sugar is dissolved. Add the milk slowly and only as much as is needed to make a thick, smooth paste.\n\nWhen the buns have cooled but are still warm, streak the glaze over them by dipping the tines of a fork or a whisk into the glaze and waving the fork or whisk over the tops. Or, form the streaks by dipping your fingers in the glaze and letting it drip off as you wave them over the tops of the buns. (Remember to wear latex gloves.)\n\n**Caramel Glaze for Sticky Buns**\n\nCaramel glaze is essentially some combination of sugar and fat, cooked until it caramelizes. The trick is catching it just when the sugar melts and lightly caramelizes to a golden amber. Then it will cool to a soft, creamy caramel. If you wait too long and the glaze turns dark brown, it will cool to a hard, crack-your-teeth consistency. Most sticky bun glazes contain other ingredients to influence flavor and texture, such as corn syrup to keep the sugar from crystallizing and flavor extracts or oils, such as vanilla or lemon. This version makes the best sticky bun glaze of any I’ve tried. It was developed by my wife, Susan, for Brother Juniper’s Café in Forestville, California.\n\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, combine ½ cup granulated sugar, ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ pound unsalted butter, at room temperature.\n\nCream together for 2 minutes on high speed with the paddle attachment. Add ½ cup corn syrup and 1 teaspoon lemon, orange, or vanilla extract. Continue to cream for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.\n\nUse as much of this as you need to cover the bottom of the pan with a ¼-inch layer. Refrigerate and save any excess for future use; it will keep for months in a sealed container.\n\n",

		"directions": "MAKE THE BROTH:\n\nRinse the bones and boneless beef. Peel and cut apple into chunks. Halve the large onion and cut into thick slices. Peel ginger, halve it lengthwise, cut into chunks, then smash each piece with the side of a knife.\n\nPut the star anise, cinnamon and cloves in an 8-quart pressure cooker. Over medium heat or using the sauté function, toast for several minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant. Add the onion and ginger. (If using a stove-top pressure cooker, raise heat to medium-high.) Stir and cook for a minute or two. A little browning is O.K. Add 9 cups water.\n\nAdd the bones, beef, apple and salt. Lock the lid. If using a stovetop pressure cooker, raise heat to high and bring pressure to 15 p.s.i. Then reduce the heat to medium or medium-low. The pressure should be just high enough that a gentle, steady flow of steam comes out of the cooker’s valve. Cook for 20 minutes. If using an electric pressure cooker, set timer for 30 minutes. After cooking, both cookers will require time to allow pressure to decrease naturally, about 15 to 20 minutes. When that is done, carefully remove lid.\n\nTransfer boneless meat to a bowl, cover with water and soak for 10 minutes. This cools it and keeps it from drying out. If desired, scrape any bits of tendon from the bones and add to the bowl of water.\n\nStrain the broth into a pot through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth or muslin. Discard the remaining solids. (At this point, the broth and beef can be cooled and refrigerated for up to 3 days.) Skim all but about 3 tablespoons of fat from the broth. You should have about 8 cups of broth. Add fish sauce and more salt, if needed. Add a few pinches of sugar and more fish sauce so the broth has a rounded, intense finish that is slightly salty and slightly sweet.\n\nPREPARE THE BOWLS:\n\nFreeze the raw beef, if using, for 15 to 20 minutes, then slice very thinly across the grain. Cut cooked beef across the grain into very thin slices. Set aside.\n\nCover the dried noodles in hot tap water and soak for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pliable and opaque. Drain, then rinse to remove starch.\n\nThinly slice the small onion and soak in water 10 minutes. Slice green onions into thin rings and set aside with chopped cilantro. Arrange any optional add-ins on a plate.\n\nBring the broth to a simmer over medium heat. At the same time, fill a pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Dunk the noodles into the boiling water, using a noodle strainer or a mesh sieve, for about 15 to 20 seconds. Remove from water and divide noodles among 4 bowls.\n\nTop each bowl of noodles with cooked and raw beef, arranging the slices flat. Place a mound of onion in the center, then shower with green onion and cilantro. Finish with a sprinkle of black pepper. Give the boiling broth a final taste for seasoning. Ladle about 2 cups broth into each bowl, distributing the hot liquid evenly to warm all the ingredients.",

		"description": "Yes, cavoli means \"cabbages,\" but yes, the sauce uses cauliflower. In Italian the Brassica family terminology tends to be loose, and in Naples, home of this recipe, cavolo is also a synonym of cavolfiore, cauliflower.\n\nThose with absolutely no fear of pork fat can follow tradition and use finely diced lardo in place of the extra virgin olive oil. The hot pepper is optional, but if you do use it, don't spare it: if it's hot, it should be really hot.\n\nIn Campania, where this dish is very popular, the cauliflower tends to be green, giving the sauce a lovely green color and a slightly milder, more broccoli-like flavor. Green cauliflowers (not to be confused with the broccolo romanesco, which is similar but not the same) are increasingly available in American farmers' markets, but white will work just as well. Cauliflower and crisp crumbled sausage make for a rustic combination that evokes the Apennines in winter. And in fact the dish is also found in Abruzzo, Lazio, Umbria, and Tuscany. Broccoli and broccoli rabe are also perfect for this sauce.",

Whatever shape of pasta you use, be sure to cook it in the same water in which you boiled the vegetable.\n\n**To make the dish:**\n\n5 liters of water to a boil in an 8-liter pot over high heat. Add 3 tablespoons kosher salt, then add the vegetable and boil until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the cooking water in the pot for boiling the pasta later.\n\nPut the oil, the garlic, and the piece of chile, if using (but not the red pepper flakes), in a large, deep skillet that will hold all the pasta later. Sauté for a few minutes just until the garlic is golden and the chile has darkened, then discard the garlic and chile. Crumble the sausage meat into the skillet. Brown evenly, stirring, for about 5 minutes.\n\nRaise the heat and add the wine. Let it bubble until the smell of alcohol has disappeared, about 2 minutes. Stir often to keep the meat from sticking. Add the boiled broccoli/cauliflower and mix well. If you are using red pepper flakes instead of a single piece of chile, add them now. Make-ahead note: Everything through this step can can be done earlier in the day.\n\nBring the vegetable water back to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente.\n\nWhile the pasta is cooking, reheat the vegetable and sausage over low heat. After the pasta is half done, add a little of its cooking water to the sauce and let it absorb.\n\nWhen the pasta is al dente, transfer it, dripping wet, with a handheld colander or spider strainer (or the like) to the skillet. Mix well over low heat for just half a minute.\n\nMix in the cheese and serve immediately, either straight from the skillet or in a warmed serving bowl.",

Paratha (p. 285) or Phulka (p. 282) are equally good. Appropriate side dishes are Lucknow Sour Lentils (p.241) or Lentils with Garlic Butter (p. 238). You can serve any appetizer except kebabs and dumplings. Fresh Mint Relish (p. 309) goes extremely well with this meal.",

If the oats are sproutable, you will only need to rinse one or two times because sprouting starts fairly quickly. If you see no sprouting after three rinses and notice starchy residue with rinses, it’s most likely that your oats are not able to sprout. It’s not you doing something wrong!\n\nAs soon I see tiny little tails, I move on to the next step.\n\nDrain the oats in a fine sieve, or a flour sifter.\n\nSpread on a cookie sheet or a pizza stone. Put into a 200ºF oven for 3-4 hours, until completely dry. If you want to get extra malty flavor, continue drying for another hour or two, until the oats brown.\n\nLet cool; and grind oats with a coffee grinder, high speed blender or mill them.\n\nIf using store bought sprouted oat flour, toast it in a small skillet until it smells malty and fragrant. Let cool.\n\nWhisk oat flour with water or milk until completely dissolved, with no lumps remaining. Add salt to taste.\n\nCook on low, whisking often, until it starts to thicken. If you like more liquid consistency, remove it from heat at this point; or if you prefer thicker porridge, cook it for couple more minutes.\n\nServe hot with butter, ghee or oils like flax seed or olive.",

Although there are many similarities, not least the name, the major difference is that Scottish Perkins (or Parkins) are crisp oat biscuits, and not like the more famous softer ginger, oat and treacle Parkin cake of Northern England.\n\nIt is important to keep the biscuits as moist as possible, don’t overcook them in the oven, bring them out after ten minutes whilst still golden, soft and flexible, they will quickly firm up and become harder and crisper while cooling. The thicker the centres, the softer the biscuits are inside, (while the outside stays crisp). For much softer biscuits soak the ground oatmeal in some milk overnight before using. Put them in an air-tight tin or jar as soon as they are cool enough.\n\nMakes about 45 small Perkin Biscuits.",

		"directions": "Use a pestle and mortar (or a spice grinder) and grind up the oatmeal into smaller, finer pieces – you can soak this overnight in a little milk if you want softer biscuits. Then in a large mixing bowl sift in the plain flour and rub the softened butter into it until it becomes like fine breadcrumbs.\n\nInto the flour add the ground oatmeal, ground spices, baking powder, and sugar. Mix these in and then pour in the golden syrup (corn syrup). Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients together to start forming a stiff dough. A spoon will only get you so far, when the mixture is clumping together get your hands and fingers in and thoroughly mix the sticky dough together to make a smooth and evenly mixed dough. Add more syrup in if necessary to make a moist mixture.\n\nGrease two baking trays and pre-heat the oven to 180C.\n\nUse a dessert spoon or tablespoon to scoop out a similar sized piece of Perkin mixture each time. Roll the sticky, moist, mixture into a ball between the palms of your hands. Then flatten the ball into round discs just over 1 cm thick – as they bake they will expand and flatten out some more.\n\nPlace each round disc on a prepared, greased oven tray. When the tray is full – leave enough space between each Perkin biscuit so they can expand – place the tray in the pre-heated oven and bake at 180C for ten minutes. Pull the Perkins out of the oven when they are golden in colour and still soft. As they cool they will harden up and be very crisp on the outside and softer on the inside. Cool the Perkins on a wire rack – once cool enough put them in an air-tight tin or jar to retain as much moisture as possible.\n\nThese Perkins (Parkins) will last over a week fresh in an airtight tin or jar, eat them as they are, with some butter, or traditionally with some jam or fruit preserve. They taste really great and each time you open the jar or tin you will get a lovely smell of cinnamon.",

		"description": "This dough also makes a great oil-free pizza dough or focaccia. Refer to the variations that follow and then the formulas for Pizza Napoletana (page 207) and Focaccia (page 159).\n\nThis dough is very sticky, like ciabatta dough, so it is best made in an electric mixer or a food processor (page 55). However, if mixing by hand, use the method described on page 56.\n\nOne of the testers of this recipe, Jill Myers, suggested using sharp scissors to score the bread instead of a knife or razor. This is a great idea, as the wet dough is difficult to slit in the normal manner. If you are using this method, try to get a long angle with the shears and make a long cut rather than just short snips.\n\nPain À l’Ancienne Pizza: Heavily flour the counter and gently transfer the fully fermented dough from the bowl to the counter with a plastic scraper that has been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you. Divide the dough by continually dipping the pastry scraper into water and cutting the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces. Gently round the pieces into balls, being careful not to punch down and expel any more gas than necessary. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and spray lightly with oil. Place the floured dough balls on the parchment. Mist them with spray oil and place the pan into a food-grade plastic bag or loosely cover with plastic wrap, and return the pan to the refrigerator, unless you plan to make the pizzas immediately. These pizza doughs will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. (You may also put them into the freezer in individual zipper bags, and keep them for up to three months.) Remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before shaping and baking your pizza as you always do.\n\nPain À l’Ancienne Foccacia: Line a 17 by-12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment. With floured hands, take the fully fermented dough from the bowl and proceed with shaping instructions on page 162. Ferment at room temperature for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough rises and fills the pan, rising to about 1 inch thick. Proceed with the baking instructions for focaccia.",

		"directions": "1. Combine the flour, salt, yeast and 19 ounces of water in the bowl of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment and mix for 2 minutes on low speed. Switch to the dough hook and mix for 5 to 6 minutes on medium speed. The dough should be sticky on the bottom of the bowl, but it should release from the sides of the bowl. If not, sprinkle in a small amount of flour until this occurs (or dribble in water if the dough seems too stiff and clears the bottom as well as the sides of the bowl). Lightly oil a large bowl and immediately transfer the dough with a spatula or bowl scraper dipped in water into the bowl. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.\n\n2. Immediately place the bowl in the refrigerator and retard overnight.\n\n3. The next day, check the dough to see if it has risen in the refrigerator. It will probably be partially risen but not doubled in size (the amount of rise will depend on how cold the refrigerator is and how often the door was opened). Leave the bowl of dough out at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours (or longer if necessary) to allow the dough to wake up, lose its chill, and continue fermenting.\n4. When the dough has doubled from its original prerefrigerated size, liberally sprinkle the counter with bread flour (about 1/2 cup). Gently transfer the dough to the floured counter with a plastic dough scraper that has been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you. Try to degas the dough as little as possible as you transfer it. If the dough is very wet, sprinkle more flour over the top as well as under it. Dry your hands thoroughly and then dip them in flour. Roll the dough gently in the sprinkled flour to coat it thoroughly, simultaneously stretching it into an oblong about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide. If it is too sticky to handle, continue sprinkling flour over it. Dip a metal pastry scraper into cool water to keep it from sticking to the dough, and cut the dough in half widthwise with the pastry scraper by pressing it down through the dough until it severs it, then dipping it again in the water and repeating this action until you have cut down the full length of the dough. (Do not use this blade as a saw; use it as a pincer, pinching the dough cleanly with each cut.) Let the dough relax for 5 minutes.\n\n5. Prepare the oven for hearth baking as shown on pages 91-94, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F (550°F if your oven goes this high). Cover the back of two 17-by-12-inch sheet pans with baking parchment and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal. Proceed with shaping as shown below.\n\n \n\nShaping Pain À l’Ancienne Baguettes:\n\nTake one of the dough pieces and repeat the cutting action, but this time cut off 3 equal-sized lengths. Then do the same with the remaining half. This should give you 6 lengths.\n\nFlour your hands and carefully lift 1 of the dough strips and transfer it to an inverted parchment-lined pan, gently pulling it to the length of the pan or to the length of your baking stone. If it springs back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then gently pull it out again. Place 3 strips on the pan, and then prepare another pan and repeat with the remaining strips.\n6. Score the dough strips as for baguettes (page 90) slashing the tops with 3 diagonal cuts(or see Commentary regarding scissors). Because the dough is sticky, you may have to dip the razor blade, or serrated knife or scissors in water between each cut. You may also omit the cuts if the dough isn't cooperating.\n\n7. Take 1 pan to the preheated oven and carefully slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the baking stone (depending on the direction of the stone, you may choose to slide the dough and parchment off the side of the sheet pan instead of off the end); or bake directly on the sheet pan. Make sure the pieces aren't touching (you can reach in and straighten the parchment or the dough strips if need be). Pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, reduce the oven setting to 475°F and continue baking. Meanwhile, dust the other pan of strips with flour, mist with spray oil, and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. If you don't plan to bake these strips within 1 hour, refrigerate the pan and bake later or the next day. If you’d like to bake them as rustic, ciabatta-style breads, leave them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then bake. As the loaves proof, they will resemble and perform like ciabatta.\n8. The bread should begin to turn golden brown within 8 or 9 minutes. If the loaves are baking unevenly at this point, rotate them 180 degrees. Continue baking 10 to 15 minutes more, or until the bread is a rich golden brown and the internal temperature registers at least 205°F.\n\n9. Transfer the hot breads to a cooling rack. They should feel very light, almost airy, and will cool in about 20 minutes. While these are cooling, you can bake the remaining loaves, remembering to remove the parchment from the oven and turn the oven up to 500°F or higher before baking the second round.",
